        <p>Gilgamesh is the BEST Civ in Sid Meier's Civilization 6, and there is no evidence against that obviously true fact</p>

        <p>Just think about it, he is:</p>
        <br>
        <p>1. (irrefutably) the baddest civ of all time.</p>
        <p>2. The ABSOLUTE Goat, "hey Gilgamesh i know i just dropped 37 thermonuclear warheads on Uruk, but can you be my friend?", "I Gotchu fam".</p>
        <p>3. ziggurats are so tuff</p>
        <p>4. his soundtrack is SUCH A BANGER. modern era sumer track makes me scream in delight like a teenage girl.</p>
