# Gilgamesh Praise Website

Hey guys, its me studios, this is the why and how I made my amazing website, Gilgamesh Praise.

I used html and css files for the website itself and i used pictures of Gilgamesh from Sid Meier's Civilization 6 and the Main Menu Background from Sid Meier's Civilization 6.

I was inspired by Gilgamesh from Sid Meier's Civilization 6 and how he is the best civilization in Sid Meier's Civilization 6.

To access my website, go to:

https://omriweinmann.github.io/Gilgamesh-Praise/

uhm i used vs code and the boba drop tutorial (along with a sprinkle of divine inspiration from Gilgamesh from Sid Meier's Civilization 6)

it also features lyrics from a song from the Gilgamesh Fighters called My Gilgamesh. uhm i thought Dave Gilgamesh's voice was really good so i HAD to add the lyrics to my website.

it was a very hard decision between My Gilgamesh and EverGilgamesh but i eventually decided to go with My Gilgamesh.
